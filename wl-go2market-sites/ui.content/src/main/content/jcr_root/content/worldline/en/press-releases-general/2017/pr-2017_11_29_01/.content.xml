Since 2009, Gaïa Rating has been conducting an ESG data collection campaign covering most of the listed SMEs in France. Based on this information, companies are rated on their level of transparency and performance. Rankings were established by category of turnover in order to reward the best players from a small panel of 230 SMEs/ETI listed on the Paris stock exchange respecting 4 criteria of size and liquidity. The ESG rating agency Gaïa Rating is used by leading management companies in their management process and investment decisions.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>Sébastien Mandron, Worldline CSR Officer&lt;/span>&lt;b>,&lt;/b> states:&lt;b> &lt;/b>“Our ranking among the TOP 10 of the best-in-class companies of the Gaïa Index for their CSR performance and our two-place progression in the Index demonstrate the effectiveness of the action plan implemented as part of our long-term “TRUST 2020” CSR program.
