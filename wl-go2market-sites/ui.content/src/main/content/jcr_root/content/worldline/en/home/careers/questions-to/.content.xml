In the France zone alone\, Worldline also recruited 400 young talents on internships and on work placements this year.&amp;nbsp; These recruits can then look forward to being offered a permanent contract – around 60% of our interns and work placement people have been offered permanent employment after their first engagement.&lt;/p>\\n&lt;p>Employment opportunities at Worldline are many and varied and include Data Scientists and Data Miners\, project managers\, business engineers\, new ICT and security experts\, research and development\, database administrator specialists and architects. Joining Worldline is an opportunity to develop in a multicultural environment with a business that has a presence in 17 countries as part of a group (Atos) that itself has a presence in 70 countries.&lt;/p>&quot;},{&quot;acardion&quot;:&quot;What is the potential for career growth at Worldline?&quot;\,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;\\n&lt;p>There are two distinct career pathways available at Worldline. The traditional route is linked to management\, and opportunities exist to develop through training and internal mobility. However\, we have also developed a pathway that is dedicated to experts\, and takes into account the specific features of their careers: our partners thereby enjoy the opportunity to transition very quickly from Junior Expert to Chief Expert.&lt;br>\\n&lt;br>\\nWhat are the values of Worldline\, and how are they applied on a day-to-day basis?&lt;/p>\\n&lt;p>Our company's enterprise culture draws on values that are shared by everyone working at Worldline\, all of whom are committed to respecting these values in order to achieve the business's various objectives:&lt;/p>\\n&lt;ul>\\n&lt;li>&lt;span class=\\&quot;styled\\&quot;>&lt;b>Development of innovation&lt;/b> so as to underpin our competitivity - a growth factor that is vital in the current environment characterised by globalisation and digitalisation. Worldline encourages innovation so as to offer its customers novel and competitive solutions.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>\\n&lt;li>&lt;span class=\\&quot;styled\\&quot;>&lt;b>Customer satisfaction&lt;/b>\, which is at the heart of everything that we do: as we are committed to the high quality of our solutions and services\, and our objective is to increase the satisfaction levels of our customers in order to generate long-term loyalty.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>\\n&lt;li>&lt;span class=\\&quot;styled\\&quot;>&lt;b>Commitment to quality&lt;/b>\, which in concrete terms translates as production\, creation and execution that is beyond reproach in terms of quality for both our solutions and our customers.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>\\n&lt;li>&lt;span class=\\&quot;styled\\&quot;>&lt;b>Development of our talent&lt;/b> in order to be able to innovative\, to create high-quality solutions and to satisfy our customers.

The company's history of mergers and acquisitions in the domains of banking and multimedia means that Worldline has been able to develop a powerful enterprise culture – a culture that is founded on domains linked to payment technology\, transactions and mobility. Innovation is at the heart of Worldline's strategy\, and this has been built up over time through a mindset characterised by innovation and start-up energy supported by a powerful investment capacity.&lt;/p>\\n&lt;p>What makes us stand out from the competition is the way we support our partners.
