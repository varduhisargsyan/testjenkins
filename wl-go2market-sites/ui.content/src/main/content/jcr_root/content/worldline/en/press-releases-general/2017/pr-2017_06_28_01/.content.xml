The solution will enable all hotels that are a member of Trinity Purchasing to allow their guests to pay in their own currency when they are abroad, regardless of the country in which they are staying.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The partnership was announced on the last day of the Money 20/20 event in Copenhagen, which is aimed at fostering the growth and development of the European payments and financial services ecosystem. Trinity Purchasing can pride itself on a strong legacy in the hospitality sector, collaborating with over 1200 affiliated hotels and restaurants across 18 countries. Its customer portfolio covers all hospitality industry sectors, ranging from budget to five-star hotels, to golf resorts, rest homes, recreation centers and hotel schools. By combining the procurement needs of this extensive network of members, Trinity Purchasing can offer competitive prices without having to compromise on quality.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>In a hospitality environment where customers are increasingly demanding and increasingly vocal, hotels cannot afford not to offer a smooth, seamless customer experience. The partnership between Trinity Purchasing and Worldline sets a new standard in offering the financial transparency hotel guests have come to expect. An American who stays in a Belgian hotel, for instance, will now know in the blink of an eye exactly how many dollars he needs to pay when inserting his credit card in the payment terminal at the reception desk.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Bouke Koppert, Chief Operating Officer Continental Europe Trinity Purchasing, is confident about the improvements in customer experience this will bring to the end consumer: “In focusing on European and pan-European deals, we can propose end-to-end solutions that aim to deliver a constantly improving customer experience. In hospitality even more than in any other sector, the customer is king, and our partnership with Worldline will enable hotel guests to pay for everything in their own currency. Gone are the days of converting foreign currencies back to your own in your head. It is these types of value-adding partnerships with which we want to emphasize our focus on customer centricity.”&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The implementation of the technology and terminal compatibility in each of the 16 countries will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018, Worldline guarantees. Vincent Roland, General Manager Merchant Services at Worldline, underlines the accessibility of the solution: “we ensure that the technology will be offered as a stand-alone solution in all countries, via a single point of contact at Worldline. Moreover, by also taking this opportunity to introduce an app supporting reservations, payments, ordering hotel services…, we can really guarantee a seamless experience for the customer and the hotel – before, during and after their stay.”&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>&lt;img src=&quot;/content/dam/worldline/images/blog/7-blue-dots.png&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 11px;&quot;>&lt;br>&#xa;About Worldline&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline [Euronext: WLN] is the European leader in the payments and transactional services industry.
