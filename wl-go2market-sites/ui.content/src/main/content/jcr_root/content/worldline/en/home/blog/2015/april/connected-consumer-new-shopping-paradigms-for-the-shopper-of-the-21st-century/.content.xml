Or viewing how a cloth fits on you with one click in a digital mirror? Or getting all the promotions for your shopping list/wish list in your smart watch with the concrete location when you are in a store? Or checking-out from your mobile without the need to interact with any person/device in a shop?&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Stores have not evolved a lot since their introduction one century ago in 1916 when Piggly Wiggly store introduced self-service shopping. Today, stores are nicer, cleaner, better organized and with a huge diversity of products but the shopping process is more or less the same. Shoppers go inside the store, they get the goods they want, either by taking themselves from the shelves or with assistance from the seller, and they pay at the end before leaving with all goods.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>New technologies available in the store (smartphones, WIFI, smart electronic tags, NFC, digital signage, kiosks, smart watches, beacons, etc.) are enabling a change of paradigm and shoppers and sellers can benefit from their usage by improving the full shopping experience.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Sellers can have a direct, personalized and contextualized communication channel with each one of their shoppers during all their stay in the store and shoppers have new innovative services comparable to those they get online but with added value that they can also touch and feel the goods they are buying.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>These new Digital Stores are a good opportunity for retailers to fight against those competitors that are only online. But they are also a new platform to sell complementary services in collaboration with other industries. Additionally, this digital transformation allows stores to expose more products to their clients even reducing square meters of their shops in places where each square meter has a significant cost.&lt;/p>&#xa;"
