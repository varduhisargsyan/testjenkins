Mastercard participated alongside us in this conference and attendees had questions about both our solution and theirs, which proves that this is a strong subject.

Consumers want to be catered to the same way whether they are shopping online or in physical stores.&lt;br>&#xa;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>It is true that, in France and in Europe, the adoption rate of the new mobile technologies, like NFC, and of these new payment methods remains low but we are seeing a strong uptake and the future looks promising. The transformation of e-Commerce into m-Commerce and the ability to pay with smartphones in brick-and-mortar shops are both factors that will influence the evolution of this adoption rate.&lt;/p>&#xa;"

                text="&lt;h2>And merchants?&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>The arrival of the Internet and mobile phones revolutionized the merchantsâ€™ approach towards payments. Merchants are thinking more and more often about mixed purchases journeys in which distance and convenience selling complete each other to accompany the evolution of their customersâ€™ consumption behaviors. To this sense, we have to power this cross-channel evolution with suitable technological payment solutions.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>And what about the impacts on the banks?&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>They could be very much impacted by this evolving ecosystem. First of all, newcomers are entering the payment market without any prior experience in this industry, the latest one being Facebook. For this new breed of actors, payment is no longer just a transactional tool but a mean to retain their users. The traditional actors, such as banks and schemes (ed: Visa, Mastercard), are hard at work coming up with new innovative services in order to face these new entrants. In the past, payment pure players had the upper hand on payment methods and the focus was put on their technological features. The focus is now on the end user as well as on the provided added value.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>We have been hearing a lot about card personalization and tailoring, can you elaborate on these?&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>Up to now, end usersâ€™ experience with their payment card could be frustrating at time. Consumers would have their purchase blocked because they had reached the limit on their card, for example. The goal of MyCard Profiler is to enable consumers to change certain parameters on their card, such as the limit, the sales channels where it can be used, the allowed geographic areas and usage notifications. Specifically, consumers will, for example, set alerts on payments above a certain threshold that they themselves have set, or made from a specific country or on a certain sale channel. Consumers will have control and will therefore no longer be dependent of a card contract that they do not have full knowledge of. We provide more trust to consumers and allow them control over their spending with a more personalized service.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Advantages for banks are also numerous because it can reduce operational costs linked to customer service, limit fraudulent cases and accompany consumers towards high-end card products.&lt;/p>&#xa;"

With our expertise in each of these modules, such as mobile apps and card parameters, we have created an all-in-one environment, MyCard Profiler, in which consumers can consult their payment statements but also manage a number of parameters associated with their payment cards and their notifications. In addition, MyCard Profiler uses related Worldline solutions such as strong authentication with Trusted Authentication as opening card parameters requires a secure environment.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>Thank you for your time today, Julien.
