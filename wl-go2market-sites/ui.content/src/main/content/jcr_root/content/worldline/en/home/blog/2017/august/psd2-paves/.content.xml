It was therefore urgent to provide a &lt;b>revised regulatory framework to tackle this new situation&lt;/b>. The new Directive will also greatly benefit European consumers by making it&lt;b> easier and safer to shop online&lt;/b> and &lt;b>enabling new services to enter the market&lt;/b> to manage their bank accounts, for example to keep track of their spending on different accounts. This is now settled with PSD2. The Directive is laying down the&lt;b> rules applicable to each member of the financial services community&lt;/b> and could become a &lt;b>tremendous stimulus for developing innovative services&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;img src=&quot;/content/dam/worldline/images/blog/banners/PSD2quote-2.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; class=&quot;imagefloatleft&quot;>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>&lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;span class=&quot;section--title left&quot;>&amp;quot;Banks are facing new innovative players.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>The market players, primarily banks but also the fintechs or e-merchants associations, did not remain inactive after the &lt;b>publication of the RTS' first draft on February 23rd 2017&lt;/b>. They did not refrain from displaying concerns and &lt;b>making proposals that could be read in the May 23rd version&lt;/b>. For the banking sector, an institutional industry structured by major established groups acting under the regulation of central banks, the &lt;b>rules of the game will greatly move&lt;/b>. The Directive will certainly not prevent them to run their daily operations â€“ financial services, saving products, insurance. It will however &lt;b>enhance competition&lt;/b> through the emergence of &lt;b>new players committed to provide innovative services&lt;/b> to the customers. To some extent, the &lt;b>&amp;quot;banking product&amp;quot; could become a &amp;quot;commodity&amp;quot;&lt;/b>, a daily consumer good.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;img class=&quot;imagefloatleft&quot; style=&quot;float: left; padding-top: 7px;&quot; src=&quot;/content/dam/worldline/images/blog/banners/PSD2quote-3.png&quot;>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>&lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;span class=&quot;section--title left&quot;>&amp;quot;Fintechs are capable of moving quickly but banks can rely on their client's confidence built over the years.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>In the meantime, fintechs are determined to take advantage of the Directive in order to &lt;b>shift the current position lines&lt;/b>, in particular to sustain the web-scraping method enabling the utilization of clientsâ€™ data made available on information sites. Fintechs highlight their &lt;b>agility and capability to address customersâ€™ requests instantaneously&lt;/b>. On the other side, banking institutions may rely on their major patrimonial assets: &lt;b>customersâ€™ confidence&lt;/b> on the one hand and &lt;b>capability to manage a massive number of accounts&lt;/b> on the other hand.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;img class=&quot;imagefloatleft&quot; style=&quot;float: left; padding-top: 8px;&quot; src=&quot;/content/dam/worldline/images/blog/banners/PSD2quote-4.png&quot;>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>&lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;span class=&quot;section--title left&quot;>&amp;quot;APIs will require the banks to bring their historical information systems up-to-date.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>The Directive should have a &lt;b>technological impact&lt;/b>, at least on two main levels. First, the access and communication protocols with bank accounts. So far, interbank exchanges used standard protocols - such as Swift - that are&lt;b> genuine regulated and bounded data highways&lt;/b>. Tomorrow, they will be &lt;b>relying on APIs that banks will have to develop&lt;/b> in order to allow &lt;b>new regulated Third Party Providers to interface with their clientsâ€™ accounts&lt;/b>, therefore compelling them to&lt;b> greatly push forward their information systems&lt;/b>. Second, the openness of systems will call for&lt;b> users' strong authentication and secured exchange protocols, able to withstand cyber-attacks and misuse of sensitive data&lt;/b>. Therefore, security issues relating to the opening of exchange systems are key, all the more so as the &lt;b>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) will enter into force the same year&lt;/b> (2018) and will force them to &lt;b>preserve their customers' personal data&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;img class=&quot;imagefloatleft&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;/content/dam/worldline/images/blog/banners/PSD2quote-5.png&quot;>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>&lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;span class=&quot;section--title left&quot;>&amp;quot;Instant payments will lead to a better customer experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>The payment industry is facing changes that will require the &lt;b>development of solutions not only &amp;quot;secure by design&amp;quot; but also meeting &amp;quot;instant payment&amp;quot; requirements&lt;/b>, a new service expected by both customers and merchants. This will take place in a context where &lt;b>the act of paying will be integrated in the act of purchase&lt;/b>. An improved customer experience could &lt;b>increase the average amount of a clientâ€™s purchase&lt;/b>. E-merchants are preparing for this through a &lt;b>renewed vision of the customer path, a controlled management of clientâ€™s data and an extended use of instant account-to-account transfers&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h2>&lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;span class=&quot;section--title left&quot;>&amp;quot;Worldline is working on global offers for this global challenge.&amp;quot;&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>This evolution of payment services leads to an&lt;b> increasing use of smartphones, an enhanced utilization of clientsâ€™ data and an openness to social networks&lt;/b>. It is a kind of &amp;quot;&lt;b>uberization&lt;/b>&amp;quot; of the service that will lead players to &lt;b>questioning their strategy and position within the value chain&lt;/b>. They will notably have to evaluate threats and opportunities of a &lt;b>cooperative versus competitive relationship with other players&lt;/b> in the coming periodâ€¦ In this new context, Worldline is launching &lt;b>offers to embrace these new requirements resulting from regulation, faster processing and new customer journeys&lt;/b>. A global offer for a global challenge.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;"
