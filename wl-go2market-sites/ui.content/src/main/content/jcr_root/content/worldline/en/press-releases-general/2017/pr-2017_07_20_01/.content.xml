This objective is part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) long-term ambition “TRUST 2020: Trust at the heart of everything we do”.&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xa;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;After officially launching its “TRUST 2020” CSR ambition&amp;nbsp; in 2016 and having obtained positive results from its first year in action, Worldline has set up several endeavors to create its Gender Equity Program. For this, it has designated a Diversity Steering Committee to deliver the roadmap for reducing the female capital gap to 0 by 2020.&lt;br>&#xa;This ambitious program is fully aligned with Worldline’s aim to recognize personal talent, individual potential and contribution to the company’s targets as well as managerial skills. The objective is to ensure the equality of treatment between genders and a balanced access to managerial positions.&lt;br>&#xa;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;For Worldline, a growing part of the attractiveness of a company is based on the fairness, transparency and equity given to people in terms of recognition and promotion, notably to take charge of wider responsibilities during their careers. Besides, excellence must not be distinguished between genders but can only recognize personal talent, individual potential, results and contribution to the company’s objectives as well as managerial skills.&lt;br>&#xa;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>&#xa;The Worldline’s “Gender Equity Program” is supported by three main streams:&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>The Diversity stream: to create awareness, to develop women’s professional networks and to deliver coaching sessions to share ideas and best practices on gender diversity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>The Human Resources stream: to provide training for managers on gender equity related topics and to promote equity in recruitment, people review and nomination among others.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>The Communications stream: to promote awareness about gender equity and to ensure equity in speaking opportunities among others.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;br>&#xa;In 2017, Worldline is expecting to deliver the first results of this program and to strengthen its position as a highly attractive company for the best talents, women or men equally, wherever the company operates.&lt;br>&#xa;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>Gilles Grapinet, Worldline CEO, says:&lt;/span> “Launching our new Gender Equity Program is proof of our core value, excellence, and our aim to retain and motivate the best talents to reach the highest performance levels. This initiative is about our collective fairness as an organization, to ensure treatment equality between genders and a balanced access to managerial positions. Beyond fairness, it is also about doing an even better job together. This entire project makes the company stronger and able to face the challenges of the future ensuring a diverse and fair composition”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;h3>About Worldline&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline [Euronext: WLN] is the European leader in the payments and transactional services industry.
