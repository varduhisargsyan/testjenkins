Indeed, Worldline has been offering payment and e-billing solutions for many years now and we have learned to adapt them to the intricacy of our clients’ use cases. For example, we are able to trigger billing to the different entities of large corporations, when they are organized by divisions, by departments, or by regions, while taking into account their international scope.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>It is based on these assets that we built our WL Merchant Billing solution, to help companies simplify their billing and payment processes, and even to send payment reminders to their clients in case of overdue bills. This solution therefore covers the entire “Bill-to-Cash” process, focused on billing and payments, which is itself part of the more global “Order-to-Cash” process which covers the entire sales process, from order to payment.&lt;/p>&#xa;"

Indeed, today, we are no longer looking for product ownership rather for the right to use it at a less expensive cost. Spotify is a good example of this evolution as it has revolutionized the music usage by allowing people to have access to a huge quantity of music, practically infinite, for a low price without owning any of it. So today, the preference goes to renting a service or a product at a price corresponding to our usage. We also find this evolution in B2B where clients are no longer willing to buy industrial equipment but prefer to rent it and pay for it according to their usage.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Consequently, the digital transformation impacts both B2B and B2C at the same time, rendering the consumption of products and services faster, easier and more personalized.&lt;/p>&#xa;"
