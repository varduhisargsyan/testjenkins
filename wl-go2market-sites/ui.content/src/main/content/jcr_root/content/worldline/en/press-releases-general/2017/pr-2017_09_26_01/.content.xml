Worldline provides end customers and advisers with a solution that enables them to communicate with one another, and share and sign contracts remotely with the same sense of security as a physical interaction.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The close relationship between the client and the adviser is supported by the integration of multichannel exchanges, document sharing, collaborative work between advisers, and an expansion of the user scope with the integration of new actors such as experts and notaries. The user experience is improved with the integration of semantic analysis tools that increase the client's autonomy and improve the quality and processing time of the advisers' responses.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Société Générale’s customers are already benefitting from this service, which puts them in touch with their advisers with ease and in full confidentiality.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>WL Authentication Process Management&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Within the framework of the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), the European Banking Authority published, on 23&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> February 2017, the first draft of the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) for strong authentication. These RTS indicate that strong authentication will be necessary for card and non-card electronic payments and for access to accounts. The European Commission is set to publish the final version of the regulation in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The WL Authentication Process Management solution answers this new regulation by providing ASPSPs with a unique platform to manage the strong authentication process for all use cases.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The platform works as an &amp;quot;intelligent authentication hub&amp;quot;, connecting the use cases that require authentication with the various authentication methods.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The WL Authentication Process Management platform deals with the complexity of the RTS regulations and exemptions on behalf of banks (managing trust beneficiaries, managing the number of transactions and amounts accumulated without strong authentication for card and non-card payments, managing risk-based authentication, etc.), thereby allowing banks to be brought into compliance at an optimised cost.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;&lt;i>For more than 45 years, Worldline has been striving to provide its customers with innovative solutions that answer a constantly evolving environment, demanding greater security, interoperability and innovation in the services offered to end customers. As the European leader in the payment and transactional services industry, Worldline is ready to provide support to banks in their ongoing digital transformation to ensure they can offer innovative services to their customers&lt;/i>,&amp;quot; &lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>explains Marc-Henri Desportes, General Manager of Worldline.&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>About Worldline&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline [Euronext: WLN] is the European leader and a global player in the payments and transactional services industry.
