First, this opportunity allowed us to enhance our visibility and to strengthen our partnership with Samsung, signed in 2013. Second, it was the chance to participate in the building of a complete customer experience in tomorrow’s digital world. This enabled us to highlight some of our innovative solutions that solve these new business paradigms in which the physical and the digital combine.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>&lt;b>Alexandre&lt;/b>: Our BTIC* and trade shows allow us to demonstrate our innovations and our products to our customers in a set context. This partnership provided a complementary way to showcase our expertise in a real-life situation.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>&lt;b>Armelle&lt;/b>: I would add that, through our participation in this event, we were able to also put the focus on the complementary relationship between Samsung products and our solutions.&lt;br>&#xa;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;h2>What were, in your opinion, the main goals of this event for Samsung and for us?&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>&lt;b>Armelle&lt;/b>: Samsung’s goals were varied: the priority was to highlight their new B2B brand, Samsung Business, but also all their new products such as the Samsung S6 or S6 Edge, as well as their screens and their digital mirror. In addition, Samsung wanted to display their vertical ability and all of their products.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>&lt;b>Michel&lt;/b>: Indeed, Samsung wanted, through this event, to showcase their products, well-known to end consumers, like their latest smartphones, their tablets or their digital mirror (ed: which can receive advertising) for the B2B market.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>&lt;b>Alexandre&lt;/b>: On our end, the main goal was to meet with prospects and customers and to present our solutions in a real-life setting in an innovative way, in addition, of course, to the media coverage for our brand in this event.&lt;br>&#xa;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;"
