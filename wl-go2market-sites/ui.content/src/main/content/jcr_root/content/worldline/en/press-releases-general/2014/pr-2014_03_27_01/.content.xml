                        text="&lt;p>&lt;b>The established infrastructure is being opened up to a new cross-channel payment system, allowing retailers with card terminals to receive payments via smartphones using their network operator.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Luxembourg, 27 March 2014 - Yapital has plans to be available everywhere and become the standard for mobile payments throughout Germany. The first European cross-channel payment system operator has taken a decisive step towards achieving this goal through its collaboration with Worldline. Worldline, Atos subsidiary in e-payment services, is the market leader for transaction services in Europe. Together they will enable the technical processing of Yapital payments via its existing card payment infrastructure.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Thanks to this partnership, which also involves leading network operators and terminal manufacturers, most of the German stationary retail sector will soon be able to offer an easy payment method via smartphone. Worldline is extending its authorisation host for network operators to include Yapital, which means that the system already in place at retailers for electronic payment processing will readily recognise Yapital transactions. The pilot phase will be completed in autumn of 2014.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;In Worldline, Yapital has the number one service provider for card-based payments on its side. This means that for the first time, it is possible to offer a standardised mobile payment method for the entire retail sector,&amp;quot; &lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>says Nils Winkler, Chairman of the Board of Yapital. &lt;/span>&amp;quot;This will fuel new competition in this segment. In future, customers will expect to be able to pay in-store using their smartphone.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>Wolf Kunisch, CEO of Worldline Germany &amp;amp; CEE, adds: &lt;/span>&amp;quot;Yapital is an extremely well-conceived solution. It has got off to a very good start and is one of the most promising mobile payment systems. We are convinced that it has the best chance of establishing itself as the leading player on the mobile payment market. We are therefore delighted to support Yapital in every respect on its way to becoming the standard.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;h3>About Yapital Financial AG&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Yapital is the first European, cashless cross-channel payment solution operating across all channels: in-store, mobile, online and by invoice.
