The strengths that contributed to the decision included the location in France of several remote sites over 400km away, introduced audit trail and security functionality, high staff skills, technical documentation, procedures for destroying paper archives and compliance with AFNOR NF Z 42-013 quality standard.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>Hervé Lemoine, Director responsible for French Archives, said: &lt;/span>&amp;quot;This decision underlines how competent and professional the dedicated Worldline team is, who take care of digital third party archiving, as well as the high quality of the infrastructure used and the stringent security underlying the service.
