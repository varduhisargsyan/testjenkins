                        text="&lt;p>&lt;b>Joint agreement enhances the kiosk platform of accessing promotions with Worldline’s multi-channel solutions&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>Madrid/Barcelona, 4 March 2014 - Good dealWorldline, Atos subsidiary in e-payment services and transactional services, will offer its Retail customers the most complete omni-channel digital loyalty solution, following an agreement reached with Good Deal to develop an interactive distribution system for personalized advertising. According to the agreement, Worldline will provide its demonstrated experience in online, mobile, SMS, push notifications, and email channels to enhance Good Deal’s recognized platform of promotional couponing through interactive kiosks.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The key elements of the solution developed are omni-channel retailing, integrating digital channels that allow merging of the purchasing experience and loyalty strategy; the personalization, by distributing intelligent promotions based on customer´s loyalty cards and buying history; and the transactional model, sharing the service’s success with customers.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>This solution is initially directed to the food distribution sector in Spain, Portugal, and Andorra; although the framework agreement also includes the possibility of developing projects outside of this geographic horizon, which will be addressed in a specific format.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The Worldline-Good Deal system offers multiple advantages for consumers by obtaining promotional coupons adapted to their purchasing profiles. So, after receiving a list of most buyed products on their Smartphones, the system will automatically provide the coupons for most interesting products or sections for the client. Thereby, the usage of the retailer’s promotional policy is maximized, and an updated list of purchases is available anytime.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The chains that have already tried this solution are Caprabo, Consum, Mas, and Coviran. In all these cases, a higher percentage of coupon redemption and an increase in average expenses by the kiosk users have been proved. The system also allows involving the manufacturers in customer loyalty strategies by bringing its promotions closer to end customers according to their purchasing habits, therefore reaching greater efficiency. Additionally, discounts are published more discreetly, reducing conflict at the point of sale.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>Terry Lobel, Managing Director of Worldline Iberia, stated:&lt;/span> &amp;quot;The alliance with Good Deal significantly reinforces our customer loyalty solution portfolio, which traditionally has been one of the strong suits of our service offers. The merger of the two companies allows us to give our customers an innovative answer to their needs in order to adapt their promotional systems to clients increasingly opened to technologies that improve their buying experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;h3>About Worldline&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline, an Atos subsidiary, is the European leader and a global player in the payments services industry.
