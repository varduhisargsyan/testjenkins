Worldline [Euronext: WLN], European leader in the payments and transactional services industry, and Groupement des Cartes Bancaires CB (local scheme in France) joined forces to offer a new customer experience journey that uses chatbots as an innovative channel for interaction between merchants and consumers. This new concept of &amp;quot;conversational commerce&amp;quot; puts a consumer's Facebook Messenger in touch with a merchant's chatbot.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Faced with the digital transformation happening around the world and the change in our consumption and buying habits (particularly with the arrival of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>Millennials&lt;/i>), innovation and a clear vision are mandatory for growth and development in the payments industry. Our clients therefore rely on Worldline’s expertise to anticipate these changes and take advantage of transformative technologies. That is why investing in innovation is of strategic importance for Worldline.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Facebook, WeChat, Snapchat, WhatsApp and other instant messaging services connect more than 2.5 billion people around the world, enabling both money to be transferred and consumers to interact with brands and merchants.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Starting a conversation is as easy as opening your app (Facebook Messenger, for example) and finding the brand you want to communicate with. Using chatbots, brands too are finding it easier to stay in touch with their customers; they can pick up a conversation whenever they wish through this channel.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Chatbots also represent a simple way of providing online services (virtual assistance and self-service with text, image, video, etc.) and so are creating a new channel for managing client relations and &amp;quot;pushing&amp;quot; information to users, while also offering additional means for collecting quality information as well as the possibility of making payments.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline, leader in payments and digital transformation, joins forces with CB to offer, firstly, a merchant chatbot and, secondly, an excellent in-app integration of Paylib for payment cards. The shopping experience is a convivial one, conducted through Facebook Messenger with a fully integrated payment step. For example, it is extremely easy to order and pay for a product like a sandwich or a burger from the instant messaging service.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;LAB by CB aims to incubate future trends and to innovate with new customer journeys that incorporate payment. The collaborative approach of LAB by CB helps us build partnerships and improve our chances of detecting any signs, however weak they may be. LAB by CB is a facilitator and an accelerator for bringing the most relevant innovations to the market.&amp;nbsp;Our partnership with Worldline on this conversational commerce project perfectly illustrates the raison d'être of LAB by CB. It also demonstrates the close relationship it has with players who anticipate future trends and the new technologies into which CB is determined to incorporate a fluid, ergonomic and secure&lt;i> &lt;/i>payment process,&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>explains Philippe Laulanie, CEO of CB.&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;Worldline is proud to assist and support the banking and retail sectors for more than 45&amp;nbsp;years as they develop new uses and payment experiences, help to simplify and secure these interactions. For Worldline, LAB by CB represents a great opportunity to demonstrate our capacity for innovation and for listening to the expectations of the various markets,&amp;quot;&lt;b> &lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>adds Marc-Henri Desportes, General Manager of Worldline.&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>About Groupement des Cartes Bancaires&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>CB, innovation inside.
