                text="&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>Consumers’ communication means and channels have drastically evolved during the last two decades. Where do companies stand in regards to these changes?&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Companies’ mutations are usually linked to people’s behavioral changes as consumers. With the evolution of communication and consumption habits, companies now need to be ready to answer hyper-connected, hyper-mobile and less patient consumers. It has become a necessity for companies to put in place and coordinate new communication means for the sake of a truly omnichannel customer relationship. The Worldline Cloud-based Contact Center solution, called WL Contact, ensures &lt;b>continuous interactions&lt;/b> and a &lt;b>360° view of customers&lt;/b> to help companies put this omnichannel strategy in place.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Companies must not only develop new means of interaction with their customers but also adapt their organization to these changes. It is necessary for their teams to be de-compartmentalized in order for them to be able to &lt;b>interact with customers at any time with the chosen communication channel&lt;/b>. In addition, customers need to be in touch with the right expert. The enhancement of this customer relationship at each step is mandatory and can be achieved through a &lt;b>better understanding of customers by connecting this omnichannel solution to companies’ own systems&lt;/b> such as CRM, ERP and any other knowledge databases.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>When it comes to these customers-brands interactions, what are the benefits of a Cloud-based Contact Center versus one that has to be integrated within a company’s systems?&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Since both systems share similar functionalities, choosing one of them depends on a company’s own concerns. Several factors can incite a company to choose a Cloud-based solution:&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>&lt;img src=&quot;/content/dam/worldline/images/blog/graphics/WL-contact-circuit.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot;>The Cloud is ideal for companies that have contact centers in different countries and that use multiple heterogeneous technical environments from different suppliers, bought separately at different times. This solution enables &lt;b>real-time supervision of the activities of multiple contact centers, wherever they may be&lt;/b>. The implementation of a Cloud-based solution drastically improves service quality, as the wait time can potentially be reduced to almost zero, with a minimum number of agents to field calls. The Cloud allows therefore a &lt;b>better customer service and a better control but also a better use of resources&lt;/b>.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>From a financial standpoint, the Cloud is a “&lt;b>Pay-as-you-go, scale-as-you-need&lt;/b>” business model, which means lower investment costs and usage-based billing. Worldline proposes various pricing models, like a minute-based payment which is an ideal business model for companies that have a very precise understanding of their needs and their costs, or a per-agent pricing.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>Since Worldline is in charge of the installation and the maintenance of its Cloud-based solution, it &lt;b>guarantees an ease of use for companies&lt;/b>.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>Lastly, Worldline innovates constantly in order to evolve its solutions which, in return, &lt;b>limit investments from its clients&lt;/b>.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>The Atos Group acquired Unify last year. What is Worldline’s positioning in terms of contact centers in comparison to Unify’s and how do both solutions complement each other?&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>We have developed a common approach with Unify whose team is extremely open and available. Moreover, Worldline’s and Unify’s solutions have several complementarities.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Firstly, Unify’s solution is software-based which means that it needs to be physically hosted on the client’s site or by a third-party. Worldline’s solution is &lt;b>hosted on its private Cloud&lt;/b> and therefore perfectly supplements Unify’s offers portfolio. Secondly, Worldline targets mid-sized and large companies, which have between 100 and 7,000 agents, while Unify targets a larger pool of small companies. Thirdly, Unify’s solutions are more geared towards outbound campaigns, for new customers’ acquisition for example, while Worldline is more specialized in inbound campaigns. Finally, Unify has an &lt;b>extremely innovative unified communication solution, called Circuit&lt;/b>. Integrated within WL Contact, Circuit enables us to provide a very complete service to companies who choose our Cloud-based solution.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>Given the globalization and the normalization of products, how can companies differentiate themselves?&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>According to Gartner, &lt;b>89% of company executives think that competition is no longer based on products but rather on customer experience&lt;/b>, and less than 10% of companies think that they can still differentiate themselves through their products. Product marketing has given way to customer-focused marketing, based on the concept of 360° customer knowledge. Knowledge of customers’ lifecycle is now of strategic importance, whether customers are prospects, buyers, ambassadors or detractors of the brand.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Nowadays, more and more consumers keep informed and search for other consumers’ reviews before buying; this is why it is essential for companies to follow buying paths and to adapt their strategy on the basis of customers’ reviews. According to a study by mblox, &lt;b>only 36% of consumers are satisfied with the experience they have had with brands&lt;/b>. This statistic is all the more interesting that it &lt;b>paves the way for Cloud-based solutions like WL Contact&lt;/b>, in a Cloud market that is growing 25% per annum!&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>Thank you for your time today, Arnaud. I will leave you with one final question: in your opinion, what will be the invention/innovation that will change our world in a century?&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Throughout mankind’s evolution, each economic revolution has been tied to an energy revolution. Today, the new energy revolution could be solar energy. This &lt;b>clean and democratic energy&lt;/b> can be produced and consumed locally. The photovoltaic industry has grown considerably, with prices cut by 1/3 to 1/4 and new innovations in terms of storage. You can already buy, for example, paint for buildings capable of &lt;b>capturing and transforming the heat produced by the solar energy on the walls&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&#xa;"
