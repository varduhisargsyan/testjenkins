In this context, the Global Service Line’s &lt;b>profitability&lt;/b> is &lt;b>expected at a low-twenties OMDA percentage&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>Devote a particularly strong focus to take advantage of robust market trends in Mobility &amp;amp; e-Transactional Services&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Leveraging on its strong technological assets, its know-how, and its track record in the design and operation of next-generation platforms, the Group considers that &lt;b>Mobility &amp;amp; e-Transactional Services&lt;/b> is in a position to benefit from the fast growing market trends for secured digital solutions for IoT and connected objects. Supported by a strong and diversified client base as well as by a healthy pipeline of commercial opportunities, the Global Business Line is &lt;b>expected to grow within the average of the Group &lt;/b>over the 2017-2019 period.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Mobility &amp;amp; e-Transactional Services’ &lt;b>OMDA is expected at mid-teens levels, improving over the 2017 – 2019 period&lt;/b>, thanks to gradual volume growth on maturing platforms.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>European payment industry consolidation&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Benefitting from its European intimacy and its particularly solid financial profile, &lt;b>the Group maintains a considerable focus to take advantage of the structural changes in the European payment industry&lt;/b>, as it has already done in Financial Processing and in Merchant Services with the recent acquisitions of Equens, Paysquare and KB Smartpay.
