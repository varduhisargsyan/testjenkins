It provides easy access to all the information they need to easily make the most of their visit to Barcelona from getting a dinner reservation at the top restaurants through to the best deal on a day out at a local attraction. Once guests have found a service that they want to buy, they can use a QR code to complete the purchase on their smartphone.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>For those guests who want to spend more time relaxing in the hotel, the Worldline Connected Hotel offers Connected and Immersive Rooms developed with technology from Broomx. In the Connected Room, you can remotely control the shower, lights and heating to make your stay more comfortable and convenient. In the Immersive Room, you have access to all these remote control services plus through the use of audio visual projections and virtual reality technologies, you can travel wherever you want – to the inside of a volcano: to the top of Mount Everest or to the bottom of the ocean. It is a 360 experience which transforms the entire room through audio visual projections and even a moving bed.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The Worldline PromoWall which will be located at Barcelona airport during Mobile World Congress is a smart digital services screen that can display adverts, information plus digital coupons that can be captured by shoppers with their smartphone and a generic QR code reader app. The solution also provides a campaign manager backend system that allows retailers to create, manage and schedule the promotion displayed on the PromoWall.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The Mobile World Capital, under the framework of the Mobile World Congress, launched last year the Mobile Ready week, an initiative that aimed to recognize and promote the mobile technology assets already existing in the city and facilitate the creation of new mobile-related initiatives. This year the Mobile Ready initiative will be focused on the tourism sector.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>About Worldline&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline [Euronext: WLN] is the European leader in the payments and transactional services industry.
