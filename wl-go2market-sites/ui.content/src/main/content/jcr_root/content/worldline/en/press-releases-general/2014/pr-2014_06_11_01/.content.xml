In the &lt;a title=&quot;http://worldline.com/content/dam/worldline/documents/publications/position-papers/positionpaper-fraud-en-ld.pdf&quot; href=&quot;http://worldline.com/content/dam/worldline/documents/publications/position-papers/positionpaper-fraud-en-ld.pdf&quot;>position paper&lt;/a> published today, Worldline outlines practical recommendations on how to re-assess the fraud risk in light of new threats it anticipates due the growth of the digital economy.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Following a period of decline in fraud, mainly due to the migration to EMV, Worldline now sees it slowly starting to increase and predicts that the increase will accelerate, if stronger security measures aren’t implemented. As ever, fraudsters actively seek out and exploit the weakest links in the system, and the evolving digital economy is creating new fraud threats and an increase in financial crime. Fraudsters have shifted from exploiting face-to-face to card-not-present transactions. According to the ECB, 60% of the total value of card fraud in Europe came from card-not-present payments (Card Fraud Report, Feb 2014). Countries most affected by fraud today are those with mature card markets with high e-commerce volumes (i.e. France and the UK).&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>Wolf Kunisch, Head of Financial Processing at Worldline says:&lt;/span> “Now is the time for issuers and acquirers to re-assess their situation in order to review all relevant processes, tools and measures they already have in place. These may have delivered good results in the past, but the question they should ask now is, are they sufficient to cope with a new fraud wave which may impact all channels and new means of payment. We are convinced that a new approach is necessary to beat a new fraud wave and maintain the trust of consumers “.&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;h3>Worldline solution&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>For more than 40 years, Worldline has been working on design and deployment of fraud-fighting strategies. As a result, it offers services, tools and fraud experts covering the entire Fraud Risk Management value chain.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>As fraud becomes radically more complex, a “one-size-fits-all” approach is no longer sufficient in combating fraud. The constant need for greater flexibility and high-alert data accuracy can only be provided by an intelligence-based approach which links monitoring technology – both real-time and post-authorization – with business expertise and strong workflow capabilities, complemented by strong governance to support effective investigations. Acquirers and issuers will be able to select and customize the most appropriate solution, which will deliver these key benefits:&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;ul>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>A balance between high detection rates and low false positives&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>Chargebacks brought under control&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>Strong image of trustworthiness and security&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>Improvement of services such as credit risk management, anti-money-laundering, marketing (i.e. to enrich customer knowledge, increase sales and propose tailored services to customers) by leveraging fraud analytics and big data methods&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>A more efficient fraud risk management thanks to a consistent interconnection between the different solutions applied to all payment means across&amp;nbsp; all channels&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;li>&lt;span class=&quot;styled&quot;>Maximization of revenues.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&#xa;&lt;/ul>&#xa;&lt;h3>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;h3>About Worldline&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline, an Atos subsidiary, is the European leader and a global player in the payments and transactional services industry.
