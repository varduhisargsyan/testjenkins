                        text="&lt;p>&lt;b>Paris, 20 March 2014 - Worldline, Atos subsidiary in e-payment services, has expanded its online payment platform with SOFORT Banking direct payment method. This will enable online merchants across Europe to benefit from a new addition to Worldline’s efficient and secure payment processing portfolio. This direct payment method is already well-known in several European countries including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and will therefore extend Worldline’s portfolio offering of Payment Means to its Merchants.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>SOFORT AG is now cooperating with Worldline, one of the market leaders for e-payment services in Europe: In this context, the payment method of SOFORT Banking has been integrated in the online payment platform Sips e-payment offered globally by Worldline Merchant Services Online Payment. This allows online merchants using Sips e-payment to expand their existing payment methods. By using the direct payment method, buyers and sellers can benefit from even more flexibility and convenience as regards online payment processing.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;We are very pleased about the partnership with the European number one in online payment services. With SOFORT Banking, online merchants can offer a new fast and secure payment method in their online shops that can be used at an international level. This helps us to boost our expansion throughout the continent - and also in France - and allows customers to shop online across borders&amp;quot;, &lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>says Dr. Gerrit Seidel, CEO of SOFORT AG.&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;p>The Sips e-payment solution is offered in approximately 45,000 online shops (direct and through major Banking partners in Europe) throughout the world - France, Benelux, Germany, UK, Spain, India and other Asian countries -, and is processing over 450 million transactions per year.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>&amp;quot;We have decided to offer SOFORT Banking acceptance because of the growing popularity of the payment mean among users in Europe, and the benefits it brings to the merchants in addition to the existing selection of payment methods. Like SOFORT AG, we furthermore attach great importance to the security of the provided payment methods&amp;quot;,&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;> says Christophe Duquenne, Head of Merchant Services from Worldline.&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;p>The payment method by SOFORT AG is already available in ten countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the UK, Italy, Spain, and Poland). Since the launch of SOFORT Banking in 2005, approximately 45 million transactions have been processed. Meanwhile, more than 25,000 shops are using SOFORT Banking.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>About Worldline&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline, an Atos subsidiary, is the European leader and a global player in the payments and transactional services industry.
