Can you tell us about the latest advances and developments in this prolific industry?&lt;/h2>&#xa;&lt;p>Indeed, this industry is rapidly evolving, a fact that was highlighted at this year’s CES* with new start-ups, specialized in this field, and many new concepts. What is interesting is that the current trend is the enhancement of objects, which are already helpful in our daily life, such as toothbrushes or alarm clocks for example, by adding connectivity through the Internet of Things. This trend shows that the industry is no longer just for gadgets and new concepts, which consumers have to incorporate in their daily lives in addition to what they already use. These new objects now work seamlessly in everyday life and can intercommunicate. In this context, we have already seen, for example, a connected alarm clock concept that can communicate with a connected thermostat, enabling smart temperature control based on the alarms set by the end user.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;br>&#xa;At the core of this trend are the ROI need for companies and the need of services for consumers. Indeed, recent studies have shown that consumers are willing to spend more money for connected objects but only if these objects can provide useful and tangible services.&lt;br>&#xa;&lt;/p>&#xa;"

The idea behind this connected piggy bank is to help parents in regards to the education of their children towards money and, by extension, towards the relationship with the bank, in a concrete, simple and fun way. This piggy bank was designed to evolve with the child, its functionalities adapting therefore to his age, from the early years to adolescence. For younger children, it can be used as a night light or a music player, and, when the child grows up and begins to physically put coins in it, he will be able to see these coins virtually “fall” on his savings account via the mobile app linked to the piggy bank, which is itself connected to the home’s Wi-Fi. When transfers are made on the account, the child will see it happen in real-time on the mobile app but also on his piggy bank, which will light up with each transfer. In addition, the piggy bank is also equipped with an NFC chip, which means that a transfer, or an online payment, can simply be done via smartphone by simply tapping it on the snout of the piggy bank.&lt;/p>&#xa;"
