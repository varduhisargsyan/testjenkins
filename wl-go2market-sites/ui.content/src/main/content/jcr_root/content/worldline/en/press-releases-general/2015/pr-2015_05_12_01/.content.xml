This new contract enables ING to offer the MyBank eMandate solution to its consumer, government and business clients.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>As a secure online solution, MyBank allows customers of ING Belgium to give online authorization on the eMandates for SEPA Direct Debit.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The eMandate solution is based on online banking services that debtor banks are offering. The debtor uses his already known online banking service to be identified and to authorize direct debit mandate, avoiding the inconvenience of a paper-based process. The automated eMandates solution by MyBank covers the issuing, amendment and cancellation of eMandates in a simple way as there is no need to deal with several layers of barriers. For the creditor, eMandates are simplifying the storage and retrieval of payment data.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>“After the successful migration to SEPA (Single Euro Payment Area) we are looking for new services to improve the customer experience on the usage of the SEPA payment facilities. The usage of Direct Debits requires a duly signed mandate.&amp;nbsp; In order to facilitate this process in a digital world, we are convinced that MyBank solution will simplify the process for as well the selling party as for the buying party.&amp;nbsp; The solution is also built for a cross border reach, which makes the service future proof and helps us to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business.” states Begoña Blanco Sanchez of ING Belgium.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>“We are pleased to further expand our long-term partnership with ING.&amp;nbsp; As a payment service provider, Worldline, strongly involved in SEPA migration with more than 450 million SEPA transactions processed in 2014, is always striving to offer new payment services to support the strategic orientation of its partners and customers, being one step ahead of the market trends and customer needs.” said Wolf Kunisch Managing Director for the Global Business Line Financial Processing &amp;amp; Software Licensing and for Germany &amp;amp; CEE at Worldline.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline offers a SEPA compliant solution to process SEPA Credit Transfer and eMandates with MyBank, related to the issuance, acceptance and maintenance of electronic mandates at the pan-European level.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>Visit Worldline at EBAday 2015 in Amsterdam (12-13 May 2015)&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Wednesday, May 13th – 11:30-12:15 - Stream 2&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Wolf Kunisch, Managing Director for the Financial Processing &amp;amp; Software Licensing and for Germany &amp;amp; CEE will be speaking on panel discussion about “The digital revolution” and the impacts on the future of banks.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>Contact details&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>For Worldline:&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xa;Valentine Cordelle&lt;br>&#xa;Havas Worldwide Paris&lt;br>&#xa;Tel +33 1 58 47 90 70 / Mob 06 63 08 41 20&lt;br>&#xa;Email: &lt;a title=&quot; valentine.cordelle@havasww.com&quot; href=&quot;mailto: valentine.cordelle@havasww.com&quot;>valentine.cordelle@havasww.com&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;b>For ING Belgium:&lt;/b>&lt;br>&#xa;Press office, 02/547 24 84&lt;br>&#xa;pressoffice@ing.be&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>About Worldline&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline [Euronext: WLN] is the European leader in the payments and transactional services industry.
