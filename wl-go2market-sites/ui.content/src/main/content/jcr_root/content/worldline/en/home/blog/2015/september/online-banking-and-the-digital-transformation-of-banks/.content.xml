This project is still ongoing in some banks.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>This upgrade, or modernization, includes, but is not limited to:&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>- the adaptation or overhaul of their information systems in order to work more in real time;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>- the development of services for the new channels and devices;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>- the digitization of processes such as subscribing to a product;&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>- the protection of services and transactions with, for example, the installation of our 2nd generation authentication solution, Trusted Authentication.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>The second stage is the digital transformation. Banks have to consider the digital turn and its subsequent opportunities, especially those relating to Big Data and connected objects. Indeed, with the contextual data collected on their customers, banks will be able to better understand them and thus to optimize the user experience and to proactively offer them the right products and the right deals at the right time.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Finally, at the final stage, banks will need to maintain their digital pace. To do this, banks will need to constantly keep their services and products aligned with the changing needs and expectations. In addition, they will need to establish new business models based on user experience rather than on the traditional sales of products. Lastly, they will also need to take into account what actually works, such as social media functionalities and gamification, for example.&lt;/p>&#xa;"
