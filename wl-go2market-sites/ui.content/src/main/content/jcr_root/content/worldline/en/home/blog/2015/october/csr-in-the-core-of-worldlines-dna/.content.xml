Currently, we are part of it and are taking significant inspiration from this framework. But we decided jointly, as a management team, that we also needed to pursue our own CSR approach, to put more emphasis on some more specific challenges of the Worldline business.&lt;br>&#xa;Indeed, this is consistent with the decision to partially list Worldline as a separate company, based on a recognition that Worldline operates in a different subsector of the digital services market - electronic payments and transactions – with different stakeholders, business models and customer priorities.&lt;br>&#xa;We process billions of electronic transactions, which themselves support critical business activities of our customers. Through our solutions and systems, we also contribute to fighting financial fraud and to promote more trust and transparency in many businesses and societies. We are contributing, directly, to the transformation from cash-based to cashless economies. Worldline’s CSR approach is fully aligned with our business and the expectations of what we deliver to our stakeholders, society and the environment.&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;"

Unlike many of our peer companies, Worldline doesn’t do a lot of subcontracting to external companies to develop and operate our platforms. Relying instead on our own employees makes us a highly people-intensive company, with a very high level of in-house expertise. As a result, our CSR approach focuses on people, on their well-being at work, on offering opportunities for development and growth and on ensuring that everyone shares a common understanding of the company’s strategy and direction.&lt;br>&#xa;Like any global company, we face the challenge of ensuring consistent implementation of what we do across an organization formed from a number of different businesses, that operates in 17 countries on three continents and that reflects multiple cultures and perspectives. This needs to be true not only for achieving consistency in our financial processes, sales and delivery but also in ensuring that our CSR policies are fully understood in all countries despite the cultural gap.&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;"
