                        text="&lt;p>&lt;b>Paris, 10 March 2014 - Worldline, Atos subsidiary in e-payment services transactional services, and Unowhy signed a partnership in the field of digital education. Teachers and students can now have access to a totally secure environment on a school tablet in the classroom or at home.&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>Unowhy provides an integrated educational solution on a touchscreen tablet manufactured in France and designed specifically for the educational environment. Worldline offers a cloud computing solution which enables the storage of educational content and students' personal data on secure hosting sites. The combination of these two techniques will enable students to learn, collect information and study with confidence in a dedicated educational environment that is secure from end to end.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>« Worldline is the trusted partner who gives us the means to realize our ambitions for e-education. With them, we will create an educational environment in which data and educational content will be hosted in France. In the field of education, it is essential that France retains its digital independence. This is a major issue, because we must maintain the sovereignty of our educational choices and freedom to teach children what we want »&lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;> explained Jean-Yves Hepp, President of Unowhy.&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;blockquote>« Worldline is delighted to support Unowhy in this major project, that is fundamental to the world of education. By providing innovative and flexible solutions from which students and teachers can benefit, Worldline can compete with large international platforms», &lt;span class=&quot;block--featured--title&quot;>said Claude France, CEO of Worldline in France.&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&#xa;&lt;p>The dedicated solution proposed by Unowhy and Worldline shields children from multiple advertising intrusions on internet and protects their personal data against commercial exploitation. At a time when hosting data is mainly done in the United States, this is a real alternative to the major international content and « cloud computing » platforms.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;h3>About Worldline&lt;/h3>&#xa;&lt;p>Worldline, an Atos subsidiary, is the European leader and a global player in the payments services industry.
